        Moving an outlier category (like "Other") to the end of the bar chart can be beneficial for several reasons:
        - **Clarity**: Placing the outlier category at the end helps in clearly distinguishing it from the main categories, making the chart easier to read and understand.
        - **Focus**: It allows viewers to focus on the primary data categories first, without being distracted by the outlier.
        - **Comparison**: It facilitates better comparison among the main categories by keeping them grouped together.
        - **Visual Appeal**: Enhances the visual appeal of the chart by maintaining a logical order, which can be more aesthetically pleasing.
        - **Data Integrity**: Ensures that the outlier does not skew the perception of the data distribution among the main categories.

    explanation_text = """
        When dealing with ordinal categories (such as days of the week or positive to negative categories), it is important to maintain their natural order instead of simply ordering from highest to lowest for several reasons:
        - **Contextual Understanding**: Ordinal categories have a specific sequence that provides context. For example, days of the week follow a natural progression from Monday to Sunday.
        - **Comparative Analysis**: Maintaining the order allows for easier comparison within the context of the category. For instance, seeing the progression of values across the days of the week can reveal trends that might be lost if the order is changed.
        - **Data Integrity**: Preserving the natural order ensures that the data is represented accurately and meaningfully, maintaining the integrity of the information being conveyed.
        - **User Expectations**: Viewers expect ordinal categories to follow a logical sequence. Disrupting this order can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of the data.
        - **Trend Identification**: Keeping the order helps in identifying patterns and trends that are inherent to the sequence of the categories, which might be obscured if the order is altered.

        When visualizing data for countries, it is beneficial to group them by continent before ordering from high to low for several reasons:

        - **Comparative Analysis**: It allows for better comparison within each continent, highlighting regional differences and similarities.

        When plotting a distribution, it is crucial to keep the x-axis ordered based on the x-axis values rather than ordering by the y-axis feature for several reasons:
